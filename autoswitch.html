						<h2>Autonomy Shifting for Autonomous Wheelchairs</h2>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/homeimgs/shifting.png" alt="Image from argallab." /></span> 
							Often individuals with mobility impairments would like help when controlling their assistive devices but, not <i>too much</i> help. This project seeks to determine when to automatically shift between different, 
							discrete levels-of-autonomy for users driving an autonomous wheelchair. Each level-of-autonomy provides different levels of assistance to the user to assist them in navigating different obstacle courses. For this 
							project, a study was run on 16 human subjects. The subjects could request changes in assistance while they navigated different obstacle courses. As they navigated the courses, the wheelchair measured information about the 
							user's control command quality and the environment. These measurements, as well as the user's requests, were used to train machine learning models to classify when to shift between different levels of autonomous assistance.

						<p> This project's results and my thesis shall be posted here after the manuscript has been submitted and reviewed. The manuscript, under edits as of December 2020, and will be submitted to IROS-RAL 2021.

						<h2>Further Information</h2>
						<p> I worked on this project while I was a PhD student student at Northwestern University working as a member of the <a href="https://www.argallab.northwestern.edu/"> argallab</a>. The argallab seeks to apply robotics autonomy 
							to assistive technology	to improve the lives of the differently abled. This lab resides within the <a href="https://www.sralab.org/"> Shirley Ryan AbilityLab</a>, the nation's perimer rehabilitaion hospital. 
							This project was the topic of my masters thesis. 
						</p>
						<p>	
							While at Northwestern, I won the US Department of Defense's National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate fellowship (NDSEG) 
							and was admitted to the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP). Following my masters, even after passing my qualifying exam and winning both national fellowships,
							I decided to depart Northwestern to pursue product managment.
