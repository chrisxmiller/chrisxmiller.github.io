										<h2>Tasks are Difficult...</h2>
										<p>Can we classify a task's difficulty based on how often a user commands the robot?</a></p>
									</header>
									<p>Robots have the potential to improve the lives of thousands living with disabilities worldwide. A paradigm in assistive robotics is to share control of the robot in the human-robot team. 
									The goal of this project was to investigate if machine learning methods can classify a task's difficulty by reading how frequently a user is providing joystick inputs to control a robotic arm. This is a feasability project
									to test if, whcn classifying tassk difficulty, user input frequency is a metric worth investigating further either as a standalone metric or as part of a larger set of metrics. </p>

									<h3>Data</h3>
									<p>Data was collected from 20 healthy subjects. Each subject completed 26 different manipulation tasks. After finishing a task, the user would complete the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA-TLX">NASA Task-Load Index (TLX)</a>  survey, a survey known to classify task difficulty. This created a dataset of 520 labeled, timeseries samples of user input frequency for controlling a robotic arm.</p>

										<p> *This feature is strongly correlated with task difficulty, however, length of task is only known at the completion of a task. Results with and without this metric will be presented to inform online methods.</p>
									<h4>Training Methods Used</h4>
									<p>Models were trained using <a href="https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/">Weka</a> using 10-fold cross-validation. The training methods investigated were: </p>
									<ul class="feature-icons">
										<li class="fa-angle-right">Naieve Bayes</li>
										<li class="fa-angle-right">Logistic Regression</li>
										<li class="fa-angle-right">Decision Trees</li>
										<li class="fa-angle-right">Neural Networks</li>
										<li class="fa-angle-right">Nearest Neighbor</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Two Approaches to Classifying Difficulty: Part 2</h3>
									<p>For method two, recurrent neural networks (RNN), specifically long-short term memory units (LSTMs) were investigated. Since this is a proof of concept, only the number of memory units was varied. The LSTMs were trained on both the once- 
									and twice-filtered data. <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> were used for model generation. The dataset was split 90/10 for training/testing, respectively.</p>

								<div class="container">
									<h3>Results: Part One</h3>
									<p> The best classifiers, logistic regression and a Neural Network with 50 hidden layers, were able to beat the baseline (ZeroR) by 20%. Useful classification was not derived from the Top38 label set, so, it will not be discussed.
									The most important feature for classification was the length of the dataset. In other words,
									the longer a person required to complete a task, the greater its difficulty. However, since task length isn't known until task completion, the models were retrained without this feature. The same classifiers were the best performers, 
									however, they only beat the baseline by 10%. The most important features after duration were the number of outliers and the features describing outliers. While peak accuracy compared to ZeroR on the best models fell to 10%, this still 
									indicates that the derived features of user input frequency may be helpful in difficulty classification. Classification performance may increase with a larger dataset. Click the images to enlarge. An appendix of raw data and more plots 
									can be found <a href="https://github.com/chrisxmiller/FrequencytoDifficulty/blob/master/Appendix.pdf">here</a>.</p>

									<h3>Results: Part Two</h3>
									<p>LSTM networks consisting of 10, 50, 100, and 200 LSTM memory units were trained on both the easy-hard and the easy-medium-hard labelsets for both the once- and twice-filtered datasets. The peak accuracy for the easy-hard label set
									was ~63% and occured using the twice-filtered dataset with 50-100 memory units. This indicates that proper smoothing may help to accentuate key features. The peak accuracy for the easy-medium-hard labelset did not exceed 36%; since 
									this barely exceeds the baseline classifier, it can be concluded that the LSTM network was unable to classify the easy-medium-hard label set. Similarly, the Top38 label set didn't yield meaningful results. Classification 
									performance may increase with a larger dataset and more advanced smoothing methods such as the exponential moving average. Click the images to enlarge. An appendix of raw data and more plots can be found

									<h3>Conclusions</h3>
									<p>For method one, using both statistical and user-generated features, the highest classification accuracy discovered was just above 60% using either logistic regression or a neural network when not considering the length of the data set</p>
									<p>For method two, the best performance observed using an LSTM occurred when using the twice-filtered data and 50 to 100 LSTM units. The performance was just above 60%, similar to the performance observed in method one. More advanced smoothing/filtering 
									methods may improve classification accuracy.</p>
									<p> Both methods lead to the following conclusions: </p>
									<ul class="feature-icons">
										<li class="fa-angle-right">Perhaps the tasks were too similar in difficulty</li>
										<li class="fa-angle-right">Perhaps the dataset was too small</li>
										<li class="fa-angle-right">User input frequency alone may not be sufficient for task difficulty classification</li>
										<li class="fa-angle-right">User input frequency is likely to be a viable feature in a larger feature set</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Future Work</h3>
									<p>This project will inform the design of a study that will review user input frequency as one of many metrics for eventual online, dynamic task difficulty classification and subsequent autonomy allocation. 
									Such a study will consist of more tasks that are extremely different in difficulty levels; the details of the design remain an area of active research for the author for the author’s PhD.</p>
