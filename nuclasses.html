						<h2>EECS349 Final Project: Classifying Task Difficulty</h2>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/projects/eecs349.jpg" alt="Image from Chris Miller." /></span> 
                            For my first foray into machine learning, I took <a href=" https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/349.html">EECS349: Machine Learning</a>. 
                            This class covered many of the basics of the theory behind machine learning and exposed me to some of the tools used in this domain. To complete the class, we needed to complete a project implementing
                            some of the concepts learned in class. I attempted to reuse data from another project (link) to classify which robotic arm grasping tasks are easy or hard. While my results were mixed, I learned how to
                            use TensorFlow, KERAS, and I improved upon my Python abilities.                         
                            <p>

                        <a href=" https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/396-496-7.html">EECS495: Introduction to Swarms and Multi-Robot Systems</a> reviewed the 
                        benefits and drawbacks of multi-robot systems, commonly known as swarm robots. We reviewed nearly 60 papers in the field of swarm robotics and 
                        implemented swarm robot behavior using a kilobot simulator in C++. The kilobots are small, cheap robots developed for studying swarm robots. The simulator was developed for students
                        to learn about swarms behavior and for researchers to test kilobot features. Our projects for this class included replicating shapes using the kilobot's onboard LEDs and 
                        generating a self-organizing swarm by realizing the <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_convection>brazil nut effect</a>.

                        I constructed and programmed an autonomous quadrotor for <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/academics/courses/descriptions/495-applied-mechatronics-quadrotor-design-and-control.html">ME495: 
                            Mechatronics with Quadrotor Project</a>. This drone could be both manually driven because of automated stability control (PID controllers) or flown autonomously to a point in space beneath a beacon (more PID-controllers).
                            To complete this class, the drone was constructed from pre-fabricated parts and programmed in C++ on a RapsberryPi. To characterize the drone's 
                            stability, it was suspended between two benches and impulses (a gloved finger) were applied to the system, as seen on the right.
